**Wind Energy Market Report**

**Executive Summary**

The global wind energy market has experienced significant growth over the past two decades, with installed wind generation capacity increasing by a factor of 98. Onshore and offshore wind capacities have also seen substantial growth, driven by advancements in turbine technology and declining levelised costs of electricity (LCOE). This report provides an analysis of key trends, market opportunities, and risks in the wind energy market, highlighting the potential for large-scale wind energy projects and the need for infrastructure and storage solutions to address intermittency.

**Key Trends**

1. **Rapid growth in wind energy capacity**: Global installed wind generation capacity has increased by a factor of 98 in the past two decades, from 7.5 GW in 1997 to 131 GW in 2024.
2. **Increasing onshore and offshore capacity**: Onshore wind capacity reached 1,053 GW in 2024, while offshore wind capacity reached 79.4 GW in 2024, representing a significant increase from 2015.
3. **Decline in levelised cost of electricity (LCOE)**: The global weighted-average LCOE of onshore wind fell by 70% between 2010 and 2024, while the LCOE of newly commissioned offshore wind projects fell by 62% over the same period.
4. **Advancements in turbine technology**: Modern turbines have a turbine capacity in the 3-4 MW range onshore and 8-12 MW offshore, indicating improved efficiency and capacity.
