**Green Hydrogen Sector Report: India's Path to a Sustainable Future**

**Executive Summary**

India is poised to become a global leader in the green hydrogen sector, driven by the government's ambitious goals and the country's abundant renewable energy resources. The demand for green hydrogen is expected to increase significantly by 2030, with growth rates of 30-fold and 160x. The sector is expected to attract investments worth over ₹8 lakh crores and generate over 6,00,000 jobs. However, the growth of the sector may be hindered by infrastructure challenges, cost competitiveness, policy and regulatory risks, and technology risks.

**Key Trends**

1. **Rapid growth of green hydrogen demand**: The demand for green hydrogen is expected to increase significantly by 2030, with growth rates of 30-fold and 160x.
2. **Increasing government support**: The Indian government has set a goal to increase green hydrogen production to 5 million metric tons per annum by 2030 and has launched the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) programme with a public-sector investment of ₹17,490 crore.
3. **Alignment with net-zero goals**: Green hydrogen is seen as a crucial component of India's sustainable future, aligning with the country's broader climate commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.
4. **Growing industrial demand**: India's growing industrial demand is expected to drive the growth of the green hydrogen sector.

**Market Impact**

The growth of the green hydrogen sector is expected to have a significant impact on the Indian economy, creating new opportunities for investment, job creation, and export. The sector is expected to attract investments worth over ₹8 lakh crores and generate over 6,00,000 jobs. India's abundant renewable energy resources, effective government policymaking, and growing industrial demand make it an attractive destination for the world's green hydrogen needs.

**Market Opportunities**

1. **Investment opportunities**: The green hydrogen sector is expected to attract investments worth over ₹8 lakh crores by 2030.
2. **Job creation**: The green hydrogen sector is expected to generate over 6,00,000 jobs by 2030.
3. **Export opportunities**: India's abundant renewable energy resources, effective government policymaking, and growing industrial demand make it an attractive destination for the world's green hydrogen needs.
4. **Growth potential**: The green hydrogen sector is expected to grow significantly by 2030, making it a promising area for investment and growth.

**Risks**

1. **Infrastructure challenges**: The growth of the green hydrogen sector may be hindered by the lack of infrastructure, including production, transportation, and storage facilities.
2. **Cost competitiveness**: The cost of green hydrogen may need to be competitive with fossil fuels to drive adoption and growth.
3. **Policy and regulatory risks**: Changes in government policies and regulations may impact the growth of the green hydrogen sector.
4. **Technology risks**: The development and deployment of green hydrogen technologies may be hindered by technical challenges and scalability issues.

**Future Outlook**

The green hydrogen sector is expected to play a crucial role in India's transition to a sustainable future. The government's ambitious goals and the country's abundant renewable energy resources make it an attractive destination for investment and growth. However, the sector faces significant risks, including infrastructure challenges, cost competitiveness, policy and regulatory risks, and technology risks. To overcome these risks, the government and industry stakeholders must work together to develop the necessary infrastructure, drive down costs, and deploy green hydrogen technologies at scale.
