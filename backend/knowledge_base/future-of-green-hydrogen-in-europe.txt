**Senior Energy Reporter's Report: Green Hydrogen in Europe**

**Executive Summary**

The green hydrogen industry in Europe is facing significant challenges, including limited potential for growth, high production costs, and an uncertain future. Despite the potential for significant emissions reduction, the industry relies heavily on government funding and is past the hype phase. However, with rapid action and favourable electricity cost development, green hydrogen is expected to be competitive around 2030. This report provides an analysis of the key trends, market opportunities, and risks associated with the green hydrogen industry in Europe.

**Key Trends**

1. **Limited potential for green hydrogen in Europe**: Due to insufficient expansion of renewable electricity generation, the potential for green hydrogen in Europe is very limited.
2. **High production costs**: The cost of renewable energy used in the production of green hydrogen can amount to 60% of the total production cost, making it very expensive to produce in Europe today.
3. **Increasing reliance on government funding**: Green hydrogen producers in Europe rely heavily on government funding to build production facilities.
4. **Uncertain future**: The future of the green hydrogen economy in Europe looks uncertain, and the industry is past the hype phase.
5. **Potential for significant emissions reduction**: The potential for reducing Europe's greenhouse gas emissions by using clean hydrogen is more than 800 Mt CO2/year in 2050 (19% of current GHG emissions).

**Market Impact**

The green hydrogen industry in Europe has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a potential reduction of more than 800 Mt CO2/year in 2050. However, the high production costs and limited potential for growth pose significant challenges to the industry's competitiveness. The industry's reliance on government funding also raises concerns about its long-term sustainability.

**Future Outlook**

Despite the challenges, the green hydrogen industry in Europe is expected to be competitive around 2030, with a fast ramping up and favourable electricity cost development potentially halving the production costs. Rapid action is required to allow the industry to switch to large-scale green hydrogen use at reasonable cost.
