**Senior Energy Reporter's Report: Green Hydrogen in Europe**

**Executive Summary**

The green hydrogen industry in Europe is facing significant challenges, including limited potential for domestic production, high production costs, and uncertainty in government funding. Despite these challenges, the industry has the potential for large-scale use in industries such as steel and chemicals, with competitiveness expected around 2030. This report provides an analysis of the key trends, market opportunities, and risks facing the green hydrogen industry in Europe.

**Key Trends**

1. **Limited potential for green hydrogen in Europe**: The expansion of renewable electricity generation is insufficient, making it necessary for European countries to consider green hydrogen import options.
2. **High production costs**: The cost of renewable energy used in green hydrogen production accounts for 60% of the total production cost, making it expensive to produce in Europe today.
3. **Increasing reliance on government funding**: Green hydrogen producers in Europe rely heavily on government funding to build production facilities, indicating the need for significant investment.
4. **Uncertainty in the future of green hydrogen economy**: The industry faces an uncertain future, with 2024 being a reality check for the industry and the energy transition as a whole.
5. **Potential for large-scale use**: Europe can achieve a cost-effective, robust, and strategically sensible hydrogen supply if consistent decisions are made early on, with the greatest demand expected from the steel and chemical industries.

**Market Impact**

The green hydrogen industry in Europe has the potential to create significant market opportunities, particularly in the steel and chemical industries. The industry is expected to become competitive around 2030, with a fast ramping up and favourable electricity cost development potentially halving the production costs. However, the high production costs, limited renewable energy capacity, and uncertainty in government funding pose significant risks to the industry's growth and stability.

**Future Outlook**

The future of the green hydrogen industry in Europe is uncertain, with 2024 being a reality check for the industry and the energy transition as a whole. To achieve a cost-effective, robust, and strategically sensible hydrogen supply, consistent decisions need to be made early on. The industry will need to address the high production costs, limited renewable energy capacity, and uncertainty in government funding to achieve long-term sustainability.

**Recommendations**

1. Governments and industry stakeholders should prioritize the development of renewable energy capacity to support green hydrogen production.
2. The industry should focus on reducing production costs through innovation and economies of scale.
3. Governments should provide stable and long-term funding to support the industry's growth and stability.
4. The industry should prioritize the development of a robust and strategically sensible hydrogen supply chain.

By addressing these challenges and opportunities, the green hydrogen industry in Europe can achieve long-term sustainability and contribute to a cost-effective, robust, and strategically sensible hydrogen supply.
